# Image-to-Text System using Gemini  

This is an **AI-powered Image-to-Text System** built with **Streamlit** and **Google Gemini API**. It allows users to upload an image, provide a custom prompt, and receive AI-generated responses based on the image content.

## Features  
-  **Image Upload Support** – Upload any image for AI analysis.  
-  **Google Gemini AI-Powered Processing** – Uses **Gemini API** for intelligent text generation.  
-  **Custom Prompting** – Users can ask specific questions related to the image.  
-  **Multi-Use Case** – Can be used for object detection, scene description, OCR, and more.  
-  **Streamlit UI** – Simple and interactive web-based interface.

## Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python 
- **Framework**: Streamlit 
- **AI Model**: Google Gemini API 
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - `streamlit` – Web app framework  
  - `python-dotenv` – Environment variable management  
  - `langchain` – AI model integration  
  - `langchain-google-genai` – Gemini API wrapper  
  - `google-generativeai` – Google Gemini SDK  
  - `PIL (Pillow)` – Image processing

## How It Works
1. **Upload an Image** – Select an image from your device.
2. **Enter a Prompt** – Ask the AI anything about the image (e.g., "Describe this image", "Extract the text", "Identify objects").
3. **AI Processes Image** – The system uses Gemini API to analyze the image and generate a response.
4. **View Results** – The processed text is displayed based on the prompt.
